# Study guide

When I started study with CCNA, First study meterial I used was [CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-premium-edition-9780136755494). I used that because I dind't know anything about it so thinking

>Official guide should teach you everything you need. Let's go with it.

Well.... that was not good idea. First few topics were okay. But when I got into VLAN, I didn't know what to do. It showed me a theory, but I didn't understand those commands. It says used this command but why that? why not that one. So, I decided to look for another study guide. 


## CBTNUGGET

I searched up and found out CBTNUGGET have one of popular study guide <del>Also found out official guide isn't that useful</del>. It give you 1 week trail so I tried it and it was awesome. It give you videos to study so you can do on your on pace and shows how many hours left so you can track how far you went. 


### Study environment

So I carried on with it and while going threw, it showed me 2 way to set up environment for study. One way was using virtual machine to build virtual lab such as [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com) or [CISCO VIRL](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/cisco-modeling-labs-personal/cisco-cml-personal). Another way was using actual enterprise equipment and build lab with it. 


#### Physical lab

I chose to go with physical lab because I like handling actual physical device and I was thinking to implement those equipment to my network and play with it .Of course I'm not buying brand new equipment. Those thing start from few thousands dollars to tens of thousands dollars. But ones that are retiring from enterprise are dirty cheap compare to brand new. And it is enough to study for certification.  


##### My equipment

For the equipment, you will be fine with 1 router and 1 switch. you will get to use all of commands but you will be lack of ospf, vtp, cdp, lldp, ect. So my recommandetion is get 3 router and 3 switch. I'm going to implement it my network so I'm going to need least 1 router capable of 1 Gigabit. I looked on craigslist and found one 2960-S, two 3750-X and three 2811
