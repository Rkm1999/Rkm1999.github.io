# Study guide

When I started study with CCNA, First study meterial I used was [CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-premium-edition-9780136755494). I used that because I dind't know anything about it so thinking

>Official guide should teach you everything you need. Let's go with it.

Well.... that was not good idea. First few topics were okay. But when I got into VLAN, I didn't know what to do. It showed me a theory, but I didn't understand those commands. It says used this command but why that? why not that one. So, I decided to look for another study guide. 


## CBTNUGGET

I searched up and found out CBTNUGGET have one of popular study guide <del>Also found out official guide isn't that useful</del>. It give you 1 week trail so I tried it and it was awesome. It give you videos to study so you can do on your on pace and shows how many hours left so you can track how far you went.
