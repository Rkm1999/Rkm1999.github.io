#About me
Currently living at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Trying to get into network industry. Have acheived [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) and working on [Devnet](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/devnet/cisco-certified-devnet-associate.html). 



#Why I started with networking
First, I found out about this industry with a Ad. I was just browing on YouTube and I saw a [Ad](https://youtu.be/VMcvOVTXAZc) and

>Isn't it perfect opportunity to me? I didn't go to the university (Well... I didn't graduate high school) and was into electronic building and repairs and had some experiences with it.

So I decied to start it right away. And I changed my mind about Ads. Sometimes something little as Ad could change your whole life.



##Why networking
while I worked on [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support?utm_source=yt&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=channel&utm_content=google), I was thinking 

>What kind of job opportunity can I get with this certification?

I started to searching it up and **Well... not alot**. It teaches you about basic computer maintenance, networking, how operating system works, how to manage it, and some security.

That's what you need for basic help desk kind of jobs, but it's pretty recent and it doesn't have much name on industry. Even Google doesn't post it on job description. At least you can put "Google" on your resume and show interviewer that you did something with "Google".

I searched up more and found out [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) and [Comptia A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) is most popular certification for starter. I compared between two and chose to go with CCNA

Reasons I came up was First I had some experience with contents on Comptia A+ but I dind't have experience with contents on CCNA! Of course, salary was one of the reason. On the paper CCNA have average of 60K and Comptia A+ have average of 50K. And it seemed like networking had more potential to me. Every companies have networking and they will need someone to manage it and with this virus going on right now (as 2021) most company started to offer remote work and of course it will require someone to manage it.
