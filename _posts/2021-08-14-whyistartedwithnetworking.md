# Why I started with networking
One day, I was just browing on YouTube and I found out about this industry with a Ad. I saw a [Ad](https://youtu.be/VMcvOVTXAZc) and

>Isn't it great opportunity to me? I didn't go to the university (Well... I didn't graduate high school) and was into computer building and repairs and had some experiences with it.

So I decied to start it right away. And I changed my mind about Ads. Sometimes something little as Ad could change your whole life.


## Google IT Support Professional Certificate
while I worked on [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support?utm_source=yt&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=channel&utm_content=google), I was thinking 

>What kind of job opportunity can I get with this certification?

I started to searching it up and **Well... not alot**. It teaches you about basic computer maintenance, networking, how operating system works, how to manage it, and some security.

That's what you need for basic help desk kind of jobs, but certification is too recent to have name on industry. Even Google doesn't post it on job description. Then what do you get with it? I looked it up and it says 

>At least you can put "Google" on your resume and show interviewer that you did something with "Google".

So I turned around from it and searched up what kind of certification will get me a job


## More certifications
I looked it up and came up with two certifications, [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) and [Comptia A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a). Those certifications are most popular certification for starters. I compared between two and chose to go with CCNA. Reasons I came up was 

First, I had some experience with contents on Comptia A+ but I dind't have experience with contents on CCNA! 

And Second was of course, salary was one of the reason. On the paper CCNA have average of 60K and Comptia A+ have average of 50K. 

Lastly, It seemed like networking had more potential to me. Every companies have networking and they will need someone to manage it and with pandemic  going on right now (as 2021) most company started to offer remote work and of course it will require someone to manage it. I saw a potentials there.

# Conclusion
Currently, I have achieved CCNA. And working on DEVNET and KUBERNETES. With all of knowledges I have learned during CCNA, DEVNET and KUBERNETES, I have built homelab so I can show what I have learned and know how to implement those knowledges into real life. With all of these, I'm going to look for a job and I will post more about it later when I get a job.
